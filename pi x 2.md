Excellent—let’s do (1) connections and (5) adaptive/non-Euclidean extensions side-by-side. I’ll keep this tight, with concrete formulas you can test.

A) Connections map: each π-family → Adaptive-π (πₐ) & geometry/physics

Guiding idea.
Define a local, scale-aware π on a Riemannian manifold  by the geodesic circle ratio

\boxed{\;\pi_{\!a}(p,r)\;:=\;\frac{C_p(r)}{2\,r}\;}

With Gaussian curvature  (2D) or sectional curvature along the disk, the small- expansions are

\begin{aligned}
C_p(r) &= 2\pi r\Big(1-\frac{K(p)}{6}\,r^2+O(r^4)\Big),\\
A_p(r) &= \pi r^2\Big(1-\frac{K(p)}{12}\,r^2+O(r^4)\Big),\\
\Rightarrow\;\;\pi_{\!a}(p,r) &= \pi\Big(1-\frac{K(p)}{6}\,r^2+O(r^4)\Big).
\end{aligned}

1) Geometry & classical formulas (1–7)

Circle/sphere area & circumference. Replace Euclidean disks by geodesic disks; use the expansions above, or exact spherical/hyperbolic forms:


C_{S^2}(r)=2\pi R\sin\!\frac rR,\quad A_{S^2}(r)=2\pi R^2\!\Big(1-\cos\frac rR\Big).

C_{\mathbb H^2}(r)=2\pi R\sinh!\frac rR,\quad A_{\mathbb H^2}(r)=2\pi R^2!\Big(\cosh\frac rR-1\Big).  These define .

Polygons (5–7). Interior-angle sums and in/ circumradius relations generalize via Gauss–Bonnet:


\sum \text{angles}=(n-2)\pi + \int_{\text{polygon}} K\,dA.

2) Physics & natural constants (8–14)

Many  factors come from solid-angle measures and Green’s functions in flat space. In curved/adaptive media, replace Euclidean measure by . The Coulomb/Poisson kernels and normalization of delta functions pick up geometry:


\Delta_g G(x,\cdot)= -\frac{\delta(\cdot)}{\sqrt{|g|}},\quad
  \text{flux over }S_r(p)\approx 4\pi_a(p,r)

Oscillators/pendula (12–13): periods gain metric-dependent effective lengths/masses; small corrections map to  via action-angle variables.


3) Analytical & complex identities (15–19)

Identities like  are algebraic; they persist unchanged.

But  as measure constant in  and Fourier transforms generalizes through volume of the unit ball and heat-kernel coefficients on , where  becomes intertwined with curvature via Minakshisundaram–Pleijel/Seeley–DeWitt coefficients.


4) Series & products (20–31)

Many π-series arise from Fourier on flat tori or elliptic integrals with constant modulus. On manifolds or media with spatially varying modulus  (think varying refractive index), π appears via spectral geometry:


\operatorname{Tr}(e^{-t\Delta_g})\sim \frac{1}{(4\pi t)^{n/2}}\sum_{m\ge 0} a_m t^m,

AGM/Borwein/Legendre methods compute  with constant . Let  (inhomogeneous medium): π-extraction becomes solving a field-coupled elliptic problem, leading to  as a functional of .


5) Asymptotics (32–34)

Stirling’s  links to Gaussian integrals. On manifolds, Laplace’s method introduces curvature into the prefactor; effectively  is modulated by the determinant of the Hessian/metric—again a  viewpoint.


6) Iterative & AGM (35–37)

Replace arithmetic/geometric means by Riemannian/Karcher means under . An “AGM on ” yields a geometric π estimator whose limit is  determined by curvature along the geodesic averaging flow.


7) Arctangent/Machin (38–42)

Machin-like constructions depend on conformal maps of the plane. On curved/adaptive surfaces, use uniformization: pull back to the plane via a conformal chart , where metric  yields a weighted arctangent identity. The weight  perturbs the linear forms in .


8) Integrals yielding π (43–47)

Replace Lebesgue measure by  and kernels by their geometric analogues (e.g., sinc via geodesic distance). Results give  or  limits as  or via spectral cutoffs.


9) Miscellaneous (48–50)

Lattice counts (Gauss circle problem) → geodesic disk lattice counts on curved meshes: asymptotics introduce curvature in the  and error terms, defining  from point distributions.

Billiard digit phenomena inherit the metric via geodesic flow;  generalizes to symbolic dynamics of the flow, with  encoded in rotation numbers.

B) Concrete adaptive/non-Euclidean generalizations you can test

G1. Local π via geodesic disks (foundational)

\boxed{\;\pi_{\!a}(p,r) = \frac{C_p(r)}{2r}
= \pi\Big(1-\frac{K(p)}{6}\,r^2 + \frac{1}{120}\big(5K^2-3\Delta K-2\|{\rm Ric}\|^2\big)r^4+\cdots\Big)}

G2. Adaptive Coulomb kernel & 

Define the geometric Green’s function  by . For small geodesic spheres,

\oint_{S_r(p)} \nabla G\cdot n\, dS \;=\; 1
\quad\Rightarrow\quad dS \sim 4\pi_a(p,r)\,r^2,

Implication: Maxwell normalizations and radiative fluxes inherit .
Test: Numerically solve Poisson on curved grid; recover  from flux.

G3. AGM on manifolds → π from Riemannian means

Define sequences on :

a_{k+1}=\operatorname{RiemMean}(a_k,b_k),
\quad b_{k+1}=\operatorname{GeoMean}_g(a_k,b_k),

Test: Implement on a sphere/hyperbolic surface; compare convergence to classical Gauss–Legendre.

G4. Spectral π via heat kernel

Use

Z(t)=\operatorname{Tr}(e^{-t\Delta_g}) \sim \frac{\operatorname{Vol}(\mathcal M)}{(4\pi t)^{n/2}}\Big(1+\tfrac{t}{6}\bar R+\cdots\Big).

\boxed{\;\pi_{\!a}^{\text{spec}}(t)
:= \left(\frac{\operatorname{Vol}(\mathcal M)}{Z(t)}\right)^{2/n}\frac{1}{4t}}

Test: GPU eigen-solvers (LOBPCG) on meshes to approximate ; extract .

G5. Adaptive Machin via conformal weight

Let . For analytic , redefine weighted arctangent:

\operatorname{arctan}_{\lambda}(x)=\int_0^x \frac{\lambda(0)^2}{\lambda(t)^2}\frac{dt}{1+t^2}.

Test: Set  from a graded index profile; search  via PSLQ.

G6. Curvature-aware integrals

Generalize  to geodesic coordinate  with Jacobian :

\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{J(s)\,ds}{1+s^2}=\pi_a.

Test: Monte-Carlo integrate on curved charts; compare to .

loads a mesh, estimates , computes  at many  and ,

fits the  law,

and runs a curved-AGM demo on .


Where do you want to start: G1 (geometry baseline) or G4 (spectral π)?
