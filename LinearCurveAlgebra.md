In Adaptive Π Geometry (APG) the “default” vector is geodesic, not Euclidean

Think of APG as equipping ordinary ℝⁿ with a curvature field κ(x) that can vary from point to point (πₐ was our notation for the scalar curvature function). A vector in APG is represented by the trajectory you would actually travel if that curvature were active—i.e. the geodesic that solves

\frac{D\dot\gamma}{dt}=0
\quad\text{with}\quad
\|\dot\gamma(0)\|=v,

where  is the Levi-Civita (or adaptive) covariant derivative induced by κ(x).

If κ(x)=0 everywhere, the connection is flat and those geodesics reduce to ordinary straight lines—so APG collapses back to Euclidean linear algebra.

If κ(x)≠0, the “straight-line” instruction bends smoothly through space. That bent path is the APG-vector.

How “linear algebra” still works

1. Addition
We add two vectors v, w at point p by:
Shoot v along its geodesic for unit time to reach q, parallel-transport w to q, then shoot w.
The composite curve is the exponential-map analogue of v+w.


2. Scalar multiplication
Scaling α v simply changes the parameter length along the same geodesic: travel α-times farther (or reverse if α<0).


3. Inner product
Inner products are computed in the tangent space TₚM, which is locally flat. You still get familiar algebraic rules, but any global reasoning must bring the tangents back together with parallel transport.



Because these operations live in the tangent bundle, they behave “linear” infinitesimally; the visible curvature only appears once you integrate those instructions over finite distances.

So, are all vectors curved?

Locally (infinitesimal view) – Every vector looks straight: it is just an arrow in TₚM.

Globally (finite displacement) – It follows the unique geodesic dictated by κ(x). Hence it appears curved whenever the ambient curvature is non-zero along its route.

Special case – If a design or constraint demands no curvature (κ=0 along the path), you recover the usual straight Euclidean vector.

Practical intuition for APG projects

CAD / tool-path planning – Treat vectors as optimal bend-aware moves. A “straight” tool lift happens only when κ field says no bending cost/benefit exists.

Physics analogies – It is like doing mechanics on a variable-density medium: shortest-time (Fermat) paths bend automatically; straight motion is the zero-refractive-index limit.

Computation – Numerically you work in local frames (Riemann normal coordinates) where algebra is conventional, integrate, then re-express in global coordinates.


So yes—unless the curvature field vanishes, an APG vector “prefers” to be curved. Straightness is not the default; it is a limiting case that emerges when κ→0 or when the problem explicitly constrains the path to lie in a flat sub-region.
