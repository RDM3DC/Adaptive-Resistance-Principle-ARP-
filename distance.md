\begin{abstract}
We present a unified framework for quantum entanglement based on the \textit{Adaptive Resistance Principle (ARP)} and \textit{adaptive geometry} $(\pi_a)$. In this formulation, entanglement arises naturally as a \textbf{geodesic locking phenomenon} in an adaptive phase space, where local curvature dynamically sculpts the shortest paths for correlated states. ARP dynamics reinforce coherent pathways and damp noisy channels, stabilizing entanglement and suppressing decoherence. This approach yields a predictive model for concurrence growth, saturation, and decay, revealing tunable ``sweet spots'' in reinforcement $(\alpha)$ and damping $(\mu)$ parameters that maximize stability without runaway effects. Simulations reproduce key experimental signatures, including CHSH violations approaching the Tsirelson bound, enhanced decoherence times, and resonance-like responses to phase-length modulation. These results reframe entanglement as a controllable, resource-limited process governed by adaptive curvature and memory dynamics, opening practical avenues for quantum networking, error-tolerant quantum computing, and precision quantum sensing.

\section{Introduction}
Quantum entanglement is often described as ``spooky action at a distance,'' but our framework places it in a fully deterministic and tunable context. By integrating ARP and adaptive geometric curvature $(\pi_a)$, we show that entanglement is a natural outcome of self-reinforcing paths in phase space. This insight allows for predictive modeling and direct engineering of entangled states.

\section{Mathematical Framework}
\subsection{Adaptive Coupling Dynamics}
The evolution of pathway conductance $g_{ij}$ follows:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dg_{ij}}{dt} = \alpha \left|\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial g_{ij}}\right| - \mu g_{ij},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ controls reinforcement from coherent signals, $\mu$ governs damping, and $\mathcal{L}$ represents a loss metric such as infidelity or CHSH deficit.

\subsection{Concurrence Evolution}
The concurrence $C$ evolves as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dC}{dt} = \kappa |K_{\text{FS}}(\pi_a)| C (1-C) - \gamma_{\phi} C,
\end{equation}
with curvature $K_{\text{FS}}$ set by adaptive geometry, and dephasing $\gamma_\phi$ suppressed by ARP damping.

\section{Predictions and Experimental Validation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Tunable entanglement stabilization using $\alpha$--$\mu$ control.
  \item Plateau and resonance effects in CHSH $S$-values near optimal damping.
  \item Prolonged coherence times and reduced noise in ARP-assisted systems.
\end{itemize}

\section{Applications}
The framework suggests practical implementations in:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Quantum key distribution (QKD) with improved error tolerance.
  \item Error-corrected quantum processors using adaptive couplers.
  \item Precision sensing leveraging curvature-driven phase locking.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
By combining ARP with adaptive geometry, entanglement is revealed as a tunable and resource-bounded process. This reframing opens both theoretical insights and technological applications for the next generation of quantum systems.
