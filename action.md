Abstract

We present a concise variational framework that captures the common “drive vs dissipation” dynamics underlying conductance plasticity (Adaptive Resistance Principle, ARP), spike‑timing synaptic updates, river‑basin evolution, and photon red‑shift under cosmic expansion. By extremising a composite action

S[\mathbf q] = \int_{t_0}^{t_1}!\Bigl(F(\mathbf q) + \Phi(\dot{\mathbf q})\Bigr),dt,,,

and show how appropriate choices of the “drive” potential F and dissipation potential Φ reproduce ARP, Hebbian/Oja plasticity, and Hubble red‑shift as special cases. We sketch data‑driven identification of F, Φ and outline integration into the RealignR lifelong‑learning optimizer.

1 Motivation

Complex systems—from neuronal synapses to galactic filaments—self‑organise by reinforcing high‑flux pathways while eroding unused ones. Despite disparate physics, the governing equations often differ only by naming conventions. A unifying action clarifies this kinship and offers transferable optimisation tricks (e.g. CPR slope recovery) across domains.

2 Variational Formulation

Let $q(t)$ denote a generalised ease‑of‑flow coordinate (e.g. conductance $G_{ij}$). Choose

Drive potential $F(q)$ (pays for throughput)

Dissipation potential $\Phi(\dot q)$ (taxes change / idle capacity)

and impose a kinematic link $\dot q = \kappa,\text{flux}$.

The stationarity condition $\delta S = 0$ under this constraint yields an Euler–Lagrange ODE that balances reinforcement against decay. Positive entropy production $\sigma = 2\Phi \ge 0$ ensures thermodynamic admissibility.

2.1 Canonical choice

$F = \tfrac{\mu}{2\alpha}q^{2},; \Phi = \tfrac{1}{2}|\dot q|^{2}/\text{flux}$ ⇒ $\dot q = \alpha|\text{flux}| - \mu q$ (ARP‑type law).

3 Special Cases

3.1 Adaptive Resistance Principle (memristive wires)

$q \equiv G_{ij}$, flux $\equiv |I_{ij}|$. The canonical potentials above reproduce the standard ARP differential equation.

3.2 Spike‑Timing‑Dependent Plasticity

$q \equiv w_{ij}$ (synaptic weight), flux $\equiv$ pre–post firing correlation. Setting $F=-c,\text{corr}(t)$, $\Phi = \gamma w^{2}$ recovers Oja’s rule with activity‑driven reinforcement and receptor‑turnover decay.

3.3 Cosmic Red‑Shift

$q \equiv E = h\nu$, flux $\equiv H$ (Hubble parameter). With $F=0$, $\Phi = (\dot E)^{2}/(2H)$, stationarity plus $\dot E = -H E$ yields $E\propto e^{-Ht}$.

4 Data‑Driven Identification of $F$ and $\Phi$

Given empirical time‑series $q(t),, \text{flux}(t)$:

Fit $\dot q$ using sparse regression (SINDy) to extract coefficients.

Invert for potentials that reproduce the dynamics while minimising the dissipation measure $\sigma$.

Validate on held‑out trajectories.

This pipeline discovers ARP‑like laws in power‑grid loading or traffic datasets, enabling adaptive control via RealignR.

5 Integration into RealignR

Module variational_core.py implements symbolic derivation of Euler–Lagrange ODEs from user‑supplied $F,\Phi$.

GPT‑Copilot hook suggests dynamic schedules for $\alpha,\mu$ by monitoring entropy production $\sigma$.

Logging: write $F,\Phi,\sigma$ snapshots to the existing runs/ JSON schema for visual dashboards.

Benchmarks: replace fixed ARP update in realignr_optimizer.py with the variational engine; fallback to canonical $F,\Phi$ reproduces legacy behaviour.

6 Discussion & Outlook

The Drive–Dissipation Action unifies diverse adaptive systems under one roof, transferring optimisation heuristics (CPR, memory snapshots) between physics, biology, and machine‑learning. Future work includes stochastic extensions (noise‑driven flux), spatially distributed fields (PDE form), and quantum generalisations relevant to QCryst engines.
