Meta-variational Learning: Where the action functional itself is learned from data, not fixed.

Adaptive Structure-Preserving Flows: Combining port-Hamiltonian with data-driven dissipation and drive (where both are inferred from trajectories, not imposed).

Thermodynamics of Information Flow in Large Neural Populations: Cross-breeding information geometry, dissipative mechanics, and network science
