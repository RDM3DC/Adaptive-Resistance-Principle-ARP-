# Adaptive Clause Networks: Solving NP Problems via Symbolic Geometry and Conductive Learning

## Abstract

We present a novel framework for solving satisfiability problems using symbolic geometry and adaptive resistance dynamics. By encoding logical formulas as networks of symbolic loops and bifurcations (Curve Alphabet), and evolving variable states via the Adaptive Resistance Principle (ARP), we demonstrate emergent convergence to satisfying assignments. This method geometrically visualizes satisfiability and models clause resolution through constructive or destructive interference.

## 1. Introduction

* The Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) is the canonical NP-complete problem.
* Traditional solutions rely on brute-force search or backtracking algorithms.
* We introduce a symbolic geometry system — the **Curve Alphabet** — that maps logical elements to visual symbols.
* We combine this with **ARP**, an analog-inspired dynamic update rule that adaptively tunes variable states.

## 2. Curve Alphabet Formalism

### Logical Mappings:

| Element        | Symbol | Geometry                    |
| -------------- | ------ | --------------------------- |
| Variable `xᵢ`  | `Xᵢ`   | Orientation-preserving loop |
| Negation `¬xᵢ` | `Nᵢ`   | Reflected loop              |
| OR (`∨`)       | `O`    | 3-branch fork               |
| AND (`∧`)      | `A`    | Braided conjunction         |

### Example Formula:

```
(x₁ ∨ ¬x₂ ∨ x₃) ∧ (¬x₁ ∨ x₂ ∨ x₄)
```

becomes:

```
A( O(X1, N2, X3), O(N1, X2, X4) )
```

Each clause is encoded as a symbolic fork. The full expression is a nested braid of forked loops.

## 3. Adaptive Resistance Principle (ARP)

Each variable `xᵢ` is modeled with a conductance value `Gᵢ ∈ [0,1]`:

* `xᵢ = True` if `Gᵢ > 0.5`, else `False`

### Clause Satisfaction:

Each clause `Cⱼ` is satisfied if at least one literal is `True`. Otherwise, it produces an error signal:

```
Eⱼ = 1 - Cⱼ
```

### Update Rule:

Let `Lⱼᵢ` be the polarity of variable `xᵢ` in clause `j`: +1 (positive), -1 (negated)

The conductance evolution equation:

```
Gᵢ ← Gᵢ + α ∑ⱼ (Eⱼ · Lⱼᵢ) - μGᵢ
```

where:

* `α` is the adaptation rate
* `μ` is the decay coefficient

## 4. Simulation Results

* Initial `Gᵢ = 0.5` for all variables
* ARP dynamics applied over discrete time steps

### Sample Output:

* Convergence of `Gᵢ` to stable states
* Fork diagrams showing clause satisfaction (green = resolved, red = unresolved)
* Successful convergence to satisfying truth assignments

### Visualization:

* Line plots of `Gᵢ(t)` over 50 iterations
* Symbolic fork networks annotated with edge truth states

## 5. Multi-Solution Discovery

* Run solver with randomized initial `G`
* Cluster final truth states to find distinct solutions
* Demonstrates adaptability of system to explore solution space

---

## 6. Future Work

* Extend to larger SAT problems and CNF instances
* Analog circuit implementation using ER fluids or memristive networks
* Generalize Curve Alphabet to model TSP, graph coloring, etc.
* Explore physical implementations of clause forks in ER microfluidics

---

## 7. Conclusion

We demonstrate that symbolic logic problems like 3-SAT can be encoded geometrically and resolved through adaptive conductance dynamics. This opens a new frontier for solving NP-complete problems through physical analogs, symbolic geometry, and self-organizing computation.
