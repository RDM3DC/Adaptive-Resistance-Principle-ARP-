Great. Here's a first draft of a Curvature-Memory Conservation Law inspired by Adaptive Pi geometry:

Curvature-Memory Conservation Law (CMCL)

Statement:
In a gravitational field governed by Adaptive Pi geometry, all deviations from classical geodesic predictions (e.g., galactic rotation anomalies, lensing discrepancies, redshift inflation) are not due to unseen matter or energy but are instead conserved within dynamically evolving curvature-memory fields encoded in local geometry.

Mathematical Form (Preliminary):

Let:

 be the adaptive curvature at spacetime point  and time ,

 be the deviation from General Relativity’s curvature prediction,

 be the stored curve memory field (geometry’s response to prior field interactions),


Then:

\Delta_{\text{GR}}(x, t) = \partial_t \mathcal{M}(x, t) + \nabla \cdot \mathcal{M}(x, t)

And the total adaptive curvature becomes:

\kappa_{\text{adaptive}}(x, t) = \kappa_{\text{GR}}(x, t) + \mathcal{M}(x, t)

Interpretation:

Instead of assigning  to dark matter or dark energy, we treat it as geometry that has learned.

The evolution of  accounts for accumulation of field interactions over time (e.g., massive movements, EM stress, wave resonance).

This reframes gravitational "error" as geometric memory, not missing substance.

Would you like to plot this field or simulate a galaxy rotation curve using this model as a replacement for dark matter?
