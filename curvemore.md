Perfect. Let’s build the πₐ curvature-response system from first principles — step by step — culminating in an equation you could simulate or embed into a dynamic path planner.

1. Classical Arc Curvature Refresher

In classical differential geometry:

\kappa(s) = \frac{d\theta}{ds}

: curvature

: angle tangent vector makes with the x-axis

: arc length


For a circle: , and the full angle around a circle is .

2. Adaptive Pi Curvature Model

We define a local adaptive Pi:

\pi_a(s) = \pi \cdot (1 + \lambda \cdot f(s))

 = constraint field response function

 = sensitivity scalar


The key idea: redefine the "angle closure" requirement in a πₐ world.

Thus, adaptive curvature becomes:

\kappa_{\pi_a}(s) = \frac{d\theta}{ds} \cdot \left( \frac{\pi}{\pi_a(s)} \right)

3. Constraint Field Function 

Let’s express  as:

f(s) = \text{tr}(\mathcal{C}(s)) = C_{xx}(s) + C_{yy}(s) + C_{zz}(s)

Stress tensor measurements

Thermal field gradients

Material resistance coefficients

4. New Radius of Curvature

Given , we can solve for the adaptive radius:

r_{\pi_a}(s) = \left[ \frac{d\theta}{ds} \cdot \left( \frac{\pi}{\pi \cdot (1 + \lambda f(s))} \right) \right]^{-1}
= \frac{1 + \lambda f(s)}{\frac{d\theta}{ds}}

5. Full Toolpath Equation (Tangent Integration)

Given curvature , we can update the Frenet frame:

\frac{dT}{ds} = \kappa_{\pi_a}(s) \cdot N(s)

 is the unit tangent vector

 is the normal vector


Numerically integrating this gives a constraint-sensitive toolpath that warps as πₐ adapts.

6. πₐ Circle Closure Condition

Instead of closing a circle at , we now solve:

\int_0^L \kappa_{\pi_a}(s) \, ds = 2\pi
\Rightarrow \int_0^L \left[ \frac{d\theta}{ds} \cdot \frac{\pi}{\pi \cdot (1 + \lambda f(s))} \right] ds = 2\pi
\Rightarrow \int_0^L \frac{d\theta}{ds} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \lambda f(s)} \, ds = 2\pi

Want to simulate a simple case (say, linear f(s) or sinusoidal constraint field)? Or would you like to apply this to a specific geometry like a torus or spiral path?
