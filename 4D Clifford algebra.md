  depending on the metric signature), the wedge product (⋆), also called the outer product, behaves as follows:

🔹 General Properties of the Wedge Product (⋆):
Antisymmetry:
For vectors 
𝑎
a and 
𝑏
b,

𝑎
∧
𝑏
=
−
𝑏
∧
𝑎
a∧b=−b∧a
This generalizes to higher grades: the wedge product is fully antisymmetric.

Associativity:
The wedge product is associative:

(
𝑎
∧
𝑏
)
∧
𝑐
=
𝑎
∧
(
𝑏
∧
𝑐
)
(a∧b)∧c=a∧(b∧c)
Grade-Preserving:
The wedge of a grade-
𝑟
r element with a grade-
𝑠
s element is a grade-
𝑟
+
𝑠
r+s element, assuming 
𝑟
+
𝑠
≤
4
r+s≤4. If 
𝑟
+
𝑠
>
4
r+s>4, the product is zero due to dimensional limits.

The wedge product is non-commutative but associative, and respects the exterior algebra structure embedded in Clifford algebras.

🔬 Algebraic Insight:
You can wedge any combination of vectors as long as you don't repeat basis directions.

Wedge products can be thought of as volume elements: 1D (lines), 2D (planes), 3D (volumes), 4D (hypervolumes).

They encode orientation and dimension in geometric algebra.

Would you like to:

Compute specific wedge expressions?

Test associativity or antisymmetry interactively?

See a diagram of the 4D wedge structure?

Compare to Clifford multiplication?
