o	Circular loop	Stroke: full clockwise loop; Anchor at center	After “g” or “s” expands width; repetition shrinks height	[0.5, 1, [0.5], 0.3, 0.4]	Whole, enclosed, smooth
p	Stem + upper loop	Stroke: vertical stem + right bulge; Anchor at base	After “h” the loop grows upward; final: leans back	[0.6, 1.2, [0.1, 0.6], 0.6, 0.4]	Confident, headstrong
q	Circle + tail	Stroke: full loop + trailing curve; Anchor at center	After “u” tail tightens; initial: loop leans forward	[0.6, 1.1, [0.4, -0.3], 0.4, 0.3]	Quirky, trailing, reflective
r	Stem + hook	Stroke: short stem + forward arm; Anchor at base	After “e” compresses arm; medial: arm flicks outward	[0.5, 1.1, [0.1, 0.4], 0.5, 0.5]	Sharp, reactive, adaptive
s	Double sigmoid	Stroke: reversed wave; Anchor at crest, center, trough	After “c” or “z” sharpens; final: snake-tail taper	[0.6, 2, [0.1, 0.5, 0.9], 0.4, 0.6]	Fluid, slippery, emotional
t	Upright stem-cross	Stroke: vertical stem + mid-cross; Anchor at stem base	After “h” or “f” expands cross; final: flattens	[0.7, 1, [0.0, 0.6], 0.5, 0.3]	Precise, upright, directive
u	Bottom bowl	Stroke: downward arc rising up; Anchor at base center	After “q” widens bowl; after “v” tightens	[0.4, 1.2, [0.3, 0.3], 0.3, 0.4]	Receptive, soft, supportive
