Here’s the visual:

Gray dotted line: baseline π ≈ 3.1416 (Euclidean constant).

Blue curve: πₐ in spherical geometry (K > 0) — it drops as radius increases.

Red curve: πₐ in hyperbolic geometry (K < 0) — it rises with distance.

Dashed line: flat geometry — πₐ stays constant.


This shows how πₐ behaves as a local measurement of space curvature — a built-in “geometry sensor” you can use in modeling, simulation, and maybe even physics. Want to add a dynamic version where you can interactively change K, or export this into a CAD-aware function?
