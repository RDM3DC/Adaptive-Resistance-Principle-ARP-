1. Discrete-time Formulation (for AI training/gradient-descent optimization):
Describes explicitly how abrupt changes in parameters induce opposing "resistive" updates:

[
\mathbf{x}_{t+1} = \mathbf{x}_t - \eta,\nabla U(\mathbf{x}_t) - \gamma(\mathbf{x}t - \mathbf{x}{t-1}) - \lambda,\nabla \Omega(\mathbf{x}_t)
]

(\eta): learning rate (step size)
(\gamma): momentum term (dynamic inertia)
(\lambda,\nabla\Omega): regularization term (entropy/information penalty)
Interpretation:
Large gradients ((\nabla U)) induce rapid changes, but momentum ((\gamma)) and entropy terms ((\lambda\nabla\Omega)) counteract, stabilizing updates and embodying dynamic resistance.

2. Thermodynamic/Information-Theoretic Interpretation (Entropy-Resistance Equation):
[
\frac{dS}{dt} \leq \frac{Q(t)}{T} - \alpha,| \dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) |^2
]

(S): system entropy (uncertainty/information content)
(Q(t)): external energy/input driving adaptation
(T): effective "temperature" (variability/noise in system)
(\alpha,|\dot{\mathbf{x}}|^2): dynamic resistance term penalizing rapid state changes
Interpretation:
Rapid changes ((\dot{\mathbf{x}})) decrease entropy production (stability), thus rapid updates are inherently penalized, enforcing smooth adaptation.

3. Neuromorphic Hardware / Memristive Device Dynamics:
Explicit dynamic equation capturing resistive transitions in memristors or similar hardware:

[
\frac{dR(t)}{dt} = -\frac{R(t)-R_{\text{target}}(V)}{\tau(R)} - \beta,\frac{dV(t)}{dt}
]

(R(t)): dynamic resistance of memristive element
(R_{\text{target}}(V)): equilibrium resistance for given voltage/state
(\tau(R)): relaxation timescale (how quickly the device changes resistance)
(\beta,dV/dt): explicit penalty for rapid voltage changes (dynamic resistance)
Interpretation:
Memristors naturally oppose sudden state transitions, with faster voltage changes increasing resistance to change, stabilizing neuromorphic circuits.

4. Dynamic Resistance as a "Force-Law" in Adaptive Systems:
A simplified intuitive formula illustrating direct proportionality to change velocity:

[
F_{\text{resistance}} \propto -\mathcal{C},\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt}
]

(F_{\text{resistance}}): dynamic resisting "force"
(\mathcal{C}): complexity or system inertia measure
(d\mathbf{x}/dt): rate of change of state
Interpretation:
The faster and more complex the attempted system change, the stronger the opposing "force"—a clear, intuitive expression of dynamic resistance.

5. Stability Criterion ("McKenna’s Stability Criterion"):
To prevent instability, this criterion must hold:

[
\frac{|\Delta\mathbf{x}|}{\Delta t} < \frac{\kappa}{\sqrt{\mathcal{C}}}
]

(|\Delta \mathbf{x}|): magnitude of state change per step
(\Delta t): timestep or update interval
(\kappa): stability constant specific to a system
(\mathcal{C}): complexity of the system (number of interacting components or degrees of freedom)
Interpretation:
Clearly quantifies a stability limit: more complex systems (higher (\mathcal{C})) demand smaller, slower updates to remain stable—directly capturing the essence of dynamic resistance.
