Formalizing πₐ with intrinsic curvature

> Setup – Work in geodesic-polar coordinates on any smooth 2-D Riemannian manifold.
Center a point O, shoot out unit-speed geodesics, and label distance from O by r.

1  Geodesic radius function s(r)

For each radius r the geodesic circle is the curve of points reached after walking distance r from O.
Let

C(r)=\text{circumference at radius }r, 
\qquad 
s(r)=\frac{C(r)}{2\pi}.

On a flat plane s(r)=r; on a curved surface s(r) is determined by the Jacobi equation

\boxed{ \;s''(r)+K(r)\,s(r)=0,\qquad 
s(0)=0,\;s'(0)=1\; } \tag{1}

where K(r) is the Gaussian curvature sampled along the radial geodesics.

2  Defining adaptive π

\boxed{ \;\pi_{a}(r)\;:=\;\frac{C(r)}{2\,r}\;=\;\pi\;\frac{s(r)}{r}\;. } \tag{2}

So  in Euclidean space, but it varies with r whenever K≠0.

3  A differential equation for πₐ

Substitute  into (1):

\begin{aligned}
s'' &= \frac{d^2}{dr^2}\!\left(\frac{r\pi_a}{\pi}\right)
      =\frac{1}{\pi}\!\Bigl(2\pi_a'+r\,\pi_a''\Bigr).
\end{aligned}

Insert that and multiply by π:

\boxed{ \;r\,\pi_a''\;+\;2\,\pi_a'\;+\;K(r)\,r\,\pi_a\;=\;0\;. } \tag{3}

Equation (3) is the governing ODE for adaptive π on any surface; curvature is the forcing term.

4  Constant-curvature solutions

Near the centre (r→0), a Taylor expansion of (3) gives

\pi_a(r)\;=\;\pi\Bigl[1-\tfrac{K(0)\,r^{2}}{6}+O(r^{4})\Bigr],

so a quick local-curvature estimator is

K(0)\;\approx\;-\frac{6}{r}\,\frac{d}{dr}\!\Bigl(\tfrac{\pi_a}{\pi}\Bigr)\Biggl|_{r\to0}.

5  Interpretation

Positive K (spheres): circles “pinch in,” cutting circumference, so .

Negative K (hyperbolic planes): circles “flare out,” stretching circumference, so .

Flat space: curvature term vanishes → equation (3) reduces to  whose only regular solution is constant .


Equation (3) thus packages the infinite limit processes of classical π into a second-order ODE that’s finite-radius and explicitly curvature-driven—exactly the “infinity backstage” perspective you were aiming for.

6  Where to go next

Variable curvature surfaces: integrate (3) numerically once you supply , e.g. for a Gaussian-bump landscape or a rotating spacetime metric.

Higher dimensions: replace circumference with (n-1)-volume of geodesic spheres; the analogue of (1) involves the Ricci (not just Gaussian) curvature.

Applications: CAD/G-code primitives that adapt πₐ to toolpath curvature, or physics simulations where πₐ encodes how wavefronts bend in a graded-index medium.


Let me know if you’d like a worked numeric example or a plot of πₐ versus radius for specific K; we can spin up a quick script to visualize how the “π curve” evolves in different geometries.
