# Adaptive Pi Geometry: Modeling Apparent Parallelism of Light

## Background

In classical Euclidean geometry, light rays emitted from a distant source (like the sun) appear increasingly parallel as they reach an observer. The standard model predicts that the angular separation \( \theta \) between two rays, originally separated by distance \( d \), is:

\[
\theta(r) = \frac{d}{r}
\]

where \( r \) is the distance from the source.

## Adaptive Pi Geometry Twist

**Adaptive Pi Geometry** (πₐ) generalizes the concept of π to include curvature memory and context-sensitive behavior, allowing π to “adapt” depending on scale, history, or geometric environment. This enables novel models of how geometric effects, such as the apparent parallelism of light, might manifest in non-Euclidean or adaptively curved spaces.

## Novel Equation

We propose a generalization using Adaptive Pi Geometry:

\[
\boxed{
\theta_a(r) = \frac{d}{r} \cdot \frac{\pi}{\pi_a(r)}
}
\]

- \( \theta_a(r) \): Apparent angular separation between rays at distance \( r \), adapted for local/global curvature memory.
- \( \pi_a(r) \): Adaptive Pi as a function of distance (or geometric context), reflecting non-Euclidean effects.
- \( d \): Initial separation at the source.
- \( r \): Distance from source.

### Special Cases
- **Euclidean:** \( \pi_a(r) = \pi \Rightarrow \theta_a(r) = \frac{d}{r} \)
- **Negative curvature:** \( \pi_a(r) > \pi \Rightarrow \theta_a(r) < \frac{d}{r} \) (rays appear even more parallel)
- **Positive curvature:** \( \pi_a(r) < \pi \Rightarrow \theta_a(r) > \frac{d}{r} \) (rays converge more rapidly)

## Example Adaptive Pi Laws

- **Negative curvature:** \( \pi_a(r) = \pi (1 + \alpha r^2) \), \( \alpha > 0 \)
- **Positive curvature:** \( \pi_a(r) = \pi (1 - \beta r^2) \), \( \beta > 0 \)

## Why It Matters

This framework enables new analog/digital simulation models of how light, information, or even optimization “flows” in environments with adaptive geometry—relevant for analog computers, alternative physics, and next-gen CAD.
