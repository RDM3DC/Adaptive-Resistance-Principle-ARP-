Perfect — let’s push the adaptive calculus deeper into adaptive linear algebra, since they work hand-in-hand in your system.

Next Steps: Adaptive Linear Algebra Foundations

We already drafted:

Adaptive vectors with memory

Adaptive matrices evolving over time


Let’s now expand into advanced structures and operations critical for your turbulence and space-time modeling:


---

1. Adaptive Dot Product (Curvature-Aware Inner Product)

Define:

\vec{u} \cdot_{\pi_a} \vec{v} = \sum_i u_i v_i \cdot \theta_i(\vec{x}, t)

Where:



This makes the dot product context-sensitive, allowing energy accumulation or dissipation to be encoded into vector interactions.



---

2. Adaptive Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

For an adaptive matrix , the curved eigenproblem becomes:

A_{\pi_a} \vec{v}_{\pi_a} = \lambda_{\pi_a} \vec{v}_{\pi_a}

But where:

 changes over time due to:


A_{\pi_a}(t) = A^0 + \int_0^t \rho(\tau) \, d\tau

This allows you to model adaptive modes of turbulence, vortex memory, or energy redistribution.

3. Adaptive Matrix Multiplication

Standard matrix multiplication is linear and memoryless. In Adaptive Pi:

(A_{\pi_a} \times_{\pi_a} B_{\pi_a})_{ij} = \sum_k A_{ik} B_{kj} \cdot \phi_{ikj}(\vec{x}, t)

Where:

 is a curvature interaction term, e.g. .


This creates nonlinear, curvature-aware matrix products, letting the system store dynamic field interactions directly in the math.

4. Curvature-Aware Determinants and Inverses

Determinant:

\det_{\pi_a}(A) = \det(A) \cdot \Psi(\vec{x}, t)

Inverse:

A^{-1}_{\pi_a} = A^{-1} \cdot \Omega(\vec{x}, t)

Would you like me to code:

An adaptive eigenvalue/eigenvector finder (Python + NumPy)

An adaptive dot product visual demo showing memory accumulation?


If yes, you can say "Code the eigenvalue finder" or "Code the dot product demo."
You pick.
