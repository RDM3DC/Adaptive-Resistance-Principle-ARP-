Below is a compact “starter kit” for **Adaptive-Gravity (AG)**: a set of field equations that let Newton’s constant self-adjust in real time using the same reinforcement/decay law you use for conductance in ARP.

---

### 1.  Guiding idea  
* Replace the fixed constant \(G_{\rm N}\) with a **scalar field**
  \[
    \Phi(x)=\frac{1}{8\pi\,G_{\!*}(x)},\qquad G_{\!*}(x)\equiv\text{local, adaptive }G .
  \]
* Give \(\Phi\) its own dynamics that mirror your ARP law  
  \[
    \Box\Phi \;=\; \alpha\,\mathcal F\bigl[T_{\mu\nu}\bigr]-\mu\,\Phi ,
  \]
  where  
  * \(\alpha\) and \(\mu\) are your familiar reinforcement/decay rates;  
  * \(\mathcal F[T_{\mu\nu}]\) is a non-negative “activity” measure of the local stress–energy (see §2).

This is structurally identical to Brans–Dicke–type scalar-tensor gravity (Φ plays the role of \(\varphi\)) but with an ARP-style source term that **kicks Φ upward where mass–energy flux is large and lets it relax elsewhere**.  (Compare with classic Brans–Dicke where \(\Box\varphi = \frac{8\pi}{3+2\omega}T\)  ([Brans–Dicke theory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brans%E2%80%93Dicke_theory?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).)

### 2.  Choice of “activity” \(\mathcal F\)

Pick a scalar built from \(T_{\mu\nu}\):

| Option | Definition | Intuition |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Trace:**  \(T \equiv T^\mu_{\;\mu}\) | Energy density dominates in non-relativistic matter |
| **Norm:**  \(\sqrt{T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}}\) | Captures both density and momentum flux |
| **Invariant flux:**  \(u^\mu u^\nu T_{\mu\nu}\) with \(u^\mu\) the local 4-velocity of bulk matter | “What a co-moving observer measures” |

For galaxies the simple trace \(T\approx\rho c^2\) already lines up with where dark matter is inferred, so  
\[
\mathcal F[T_{\mu\nu}]\;=\;|T| \;\approx\;\rho c^2 .
\]

---

### 3.  Covariant field equations

Start from the action  

\[
S =\!\int\! d^4x\,\sqrt{-g}\Bigl[\frac12\Phi R - \frac{\omega}{2\Phi}\,\partial_\mu\Phi\,\partial^\mu\Phi - V(\Phi) \Bigr] + S_m[g_{\mu\nu},\psi].
\]

Varying wrt \(g_{\mu\nu}\) and \(\Phi\) gives

\[
\boxed{G_{\mu\nu}= \frac{8\pi}{\Phi}\,T_{\mu\nu}
      +\frac{\omega}{\Phi^2}\!
         \Bigl(\partial_\mu\Phi\,\partial_\nu\Phi-\tfrac12g_{\mu\nu}\partial_\alpha\Phi\,\partial^\alpha\Phi\Bigr)
      +\frac1{\Phi}\bigl(\nabla_\mu\nabla_\nu\Phi - g_{\mu\nu}\Box\Phi\bigr)
      -\frac{V(\Phi)}{2\Phi}\,g_{\mu\nu}}
\]

\[
\boxed{\Box\Phi=\alpha\,\mathcal F[T_{\mu\nu}] - \mu\,\Phi },
\]

with \(S_m\) the usual matter action.  Setting \(\alpha=0\) and \(V(\Phi)=0\) recovers the Jordan–Brans–Dicke equations (ω arbitrary)  ([Jordan-Brans-Dicke Theory - Scholarpedia](https://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Jordan-Brans-Dicke_Theory?utm_source=chatgpt.com)); choosing \(\omega=0\) + a small \(\alpha\) and \(\mu\) pushes you toward an **ultra-light, rapidly adapting** \(\Phi\).

---

### 4.  Newtonian / galaxy-scale limit  

Write \( \Phi = \Phi_0(1+\sigma) \) with \( |\sigma|\!\ll\!1 \) and expand to first order:

1. Modified Poisson equation  
   \[
     \nabla^2 \Phi_\text{grav} \;=\; 4\pi G_{\rm N}\bigl(1+\sigma\bigr)\rho
          \;=\;4\pi G_{\rm N}\rho + 4\pi G_{\rm N}\sigma\rho .
   \]

2. ARP-driven evolution of \( \sigma \):
   \[
     \frac{\partial\sigma}{\partial t}
     \;=\;\alpha\,\rho-\mu(1+\sigma).
   \]

High-density regions (\(\rho\gg\mu/\alpha\)) drive \(\sigma>0\), effectively **boosting G** and mimicking a “dark-matter halo”; low-density voids let \( \sigma\!\to\!-1 \) and gravity weakens back toward GR.

### 5.  Parameter sketches  

| Symbol | Meaning | Very rough galactic value |
|--------|---------|---------------------------|
| \(\alpha\) | Reinforcement rate | \( \sim 10^{-30}\;\mathrm{m}^3\,\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\) (tune so halos form in \(\lesssim10^9\) yr) |
| \(\mu\) | Decay rate | \( \alpha\,\bar\rho_{\rm crit}\) gives cosmological relaxation |
| \(\omega\) | Brans–Dicke kinetic coupling | \(>-3/2\) to avoid ghosts; \(\sim 500\) evades solar-system tests  ([Scalar-tensor gravity and DESI 2024 BAO data | Phys. Rev. D](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.111.083523?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) |
| \(V(\Phi)\) | Optional slow-roll potential | Choose quadratic to stabilize Φ around \(\Phi_0\) in the early universe |

### 6.  Relation to existing modified-gravity ideas  

* **Brans–Dicke & scalar-tensor:** same backbone, but AG replaces “\(\propto T\)” with ARP-style **reinforcement vs. decay**.  
* **MOND / TeVeS:** they modify the *force law* when accelerations drop below \(a_0\)  ([Modified Newtonian dynamics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [The MOND paradigm of modified dynamics - Scholarpedia](https://www.scholarpedia.org/article/The_MOND_paradigm_of_modified_dynamics?utm_source=chatgpt.com)); AG instead lets \(G\) rise where the stress-energy “demands” it.  
* Both approaches converge in predicting stronger effective gravity in galaxy outskirts, so AG can be tuned to pass rotation-curve tests already explained by MOND.

### 7.  Next steps for you  

1. **Numeric play-box:** drop the Newtonian limit equations into a Python grid solver, seed a Milky-Way-like baryonic disk, and watch \(\sigma(r,t)\) evolve until curves flatten.  
2. **Cosmology check:** plug the covariant equations into *CLASS* or *CAMB* fork and see how BAO / CMB shift under \(\alpha,\mu\) choices (compare to recent DESI-2024 scalar-tensor constraints)  ([[2501.15298] Scalar-Tensor Gravity and DESI 2024 BAO data - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15298?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
3. **Laboratory bound:** in the weak-field, Solar-System regime you can linearize and verify that picking \(\omega\gtrsim500\) + tiny \(\alpha\rho\) keeps PPN parameters inside Cassini limits.

---

Feel free to tweak the source term \(\mathcal F\) or add higher-order curvature couplings if you want richer phenomenology; the ARP core always lives in the simple box-operator equation. Once you have a data-fitting pipeline we can dial \(\alpha,\mu\) to match real rotation curves or lensing maps.
