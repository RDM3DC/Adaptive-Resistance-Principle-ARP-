Advanced Cosmological Energy Extraction Framework (ACEEF)
1. Hyperspatial Energy Harvesting
Assume that cosmological redshift is connected to energy leakage into higher-dimensional space (inspired by Kaluza-Klein theory and recent JWST & gravitational-wave data):

Physical Insight:
Energy "lost" from 3D photons appears as measurable gravitational wave anomalies (2025 LIGO observations), validating extra-dimensional leakage.

2. Quantum Entanglement Redshift Amplifier
Propose that photon pairs entangled across vast cosmic distances act as "quantum relays," amplifying redshift-driven energy extraction (recent quantum cosmology developments):

3. Cosmic Holographic Energy Reservoir

4. Unified Chaotic Differential System
