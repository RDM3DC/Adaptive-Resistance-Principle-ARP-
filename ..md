Geometric Bias Signature Equation

We define the directional curvature offset  as a function of added harmonic coefficients  in a base function , where :

\Delta(a) \approx \sum_{n \in \{2, 4, 6, 8\}} \gamma_n A_n

The coefficients  are empirically extracted curvature-bias weights, representing how much each cosine harmonic component  contributes to directional offset under a weighted mean phase algorithm.

Key Observations:

Only even harmonics contribute significantly to , revealing a hidden symmetry in directional curvature sensitivity.

Odd terms () yield negligible linear impact.

This structure implies a deeper geometric or spectral resonance law that could be sensitive to specific number-theoretic distributions (e.g., primes).


Use Case:

This signature equation can be used to:

Predict or amplify directional bias in curvature-based systems

Detect resonance with even-harmonic modulated functions

Formulate hypotheses for prime detection through geometric closure systems
